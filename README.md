* As a passenger, I want to be able to see if there are enough available
seats on the plane for my family, so I'll know if we can travel together.  


* As a passenger, I want to be able to see what the cheapest flights are
for the place I'm traveling to, so I can purchase the cheapest flight.

* As a passenger, I want to be able to see flights that can accommodate
handicapped people, so I am able to access the flight since I'm wheelchair bound.

* As a passenger, I want to see if there are cheaper flights around the date
that I picked, so I can possibly save more money $$$$$$$.
